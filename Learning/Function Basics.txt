What are functions?
To assign a set of code and possibly variables known as parameters to a little bit of text.

To start a function, do the following:

    define a function, 'def' is used short for define 
                        following the def, add a name which you will use to refer to your function
                             *Make sure this is unique as you do not want to overlap functions*
                        enter a colon after the parameters (if they're present)
                        the function will pick up on everything that is under it

Example: def example():
         print('basic function')
         z = 3+9
         print(z)

         print('hello')

        In the above, only the code that follows the function will be output
        print('hello') will not be shown
  
  to call the function, you can type out example() in the script and it will run and output the code underneath it

                                        Functions with parameters

def simple_addition(num1,num2)
    answer = num1 + num2 
    print('num1 is',num1)
    print(answer)

    The function above provides a simple addition prompt. 
    When we call the function, we will input numbers for the variables num1 and num2 
    which will then be input for num1 and num 2 in the code

                simple_addition(3,4)

                will output num1 is 3 and 
                7 as the answer
note: make sure the qty is the same as the parameters provided and the values you assign are the correct amounts

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function defaults can be called within the parameters
        ex: def simple(num1,num2=5<--- this is the default parameter)
                print (num1,num2)

            simple(2) <---- once this is called, it will display num1 as 2 and even though we didn't
                            type out the number for num2, it will still output because it was given a default parameter
                            
                            output will be: 2 and 5

                            This is useful because maybe a variable within the parameter has to be specific, but the 
                            other variables don't have to be. you could assign it in the parameters and not have to worry 
                            about it. 

                            an example could be a mortgage downpayment would have to be specific, so you could set a default parameter
                            for it
