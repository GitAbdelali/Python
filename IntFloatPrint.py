#   Writing things for each SentDex tutorial I've undergone: 
#   Int functions only with integers (Whole number) ways to bypass this is by using Float
#   Example: Print(Int(8+3.3)) will print only 11 
#            However, print(float(8+3.3)) will print 11.3
#   Text inside of single or double quotes makes the content inside it a string
#   If an apostrophe is needed in a string, adding a backslash before it will not cause any problems
#   Example: Print('We\'re going to have a great time learning python.)
#   Concatenating brings things, (strings, links, folders, etc) together in a chain or series
#   
# 
# 
# 
# 
#   Mathematical expressions
#   +, -, *, /, ** (to the power of)  

# print('we're going to have some fun learning how to code) This will not work as the ' makes things weird
# vs
print("we're going to have some fun learning to code") 
# or 
print('we\'re going to have some fun learning to code')

print(int(8+3.3))
# Vs 
print(float(8+3.3))
# Other examples
print(int(8*9))
print(int(9/3))
