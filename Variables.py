# 5/68: Variables
# Used very frequently, perhaps in almost every code written
# Examples of syntax: exampleVar - "Camel Casing"
#           example_var
#           EXAMPLE_VAR 
# Doesn't matter, camel casing is "improper"
# Examples of variables: exampleVar = 66
#                        Print(exampleVar) will output 66
# Can also be an equation EX: 66+32 = 98
# Can also be a function
# EX: exampleVar = print('Oh wow!')
# Typing exampleVar will output 'Oh wow!' 
# Unpacking a variable 
# EX: x,y = (3,5)
#     print(x) = 3
#     print(y) = 5


exampleVar = print('oh wow!')
